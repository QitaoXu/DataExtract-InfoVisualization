# DataExtract-InfoVisualization

### Introduction ###

* It is a project to extract data from simulation result files and import them into matlab to draw a 3-D scatterd heat map to make data analysis.

### Keyword ###

* GEM5: Simulation platform.
* Python: Simulation files.
* Shell: Scripts to control simulation to run on server with different arguments for 294 times, output result text files to specific directory respectively and extract data I need from those result files.
* Matlab: Platform to import data extracted by shell scripts and analyze data using m scripts to draw a 3-D scattered heat map.

### Academic Background ###

* Field: Computer Systems Architecture
* Concepts: Out-of-order execution
